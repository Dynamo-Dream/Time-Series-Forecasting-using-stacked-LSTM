# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-stacked-LSTM
### DEscription
- This project leverages five years of historical stock price data from Apple Inc., obtained through Yahoo Finance, to develop a Time Series Forecasting model using Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.
- By employing a Stacked LSTM architecture, this project harnesses the power of recurrent neural networks to capture intricate patterns and dependencies within the historical stock price data.
- LSTM networks are well-suited for sequential data, making them an ideal choice for modeling the temporal aspects of financial time series.
